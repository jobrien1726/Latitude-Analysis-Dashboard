# Web Design: Equator Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design a webpage that visualizes the data and analysis from a previous project, the GitHub for which can be found [here](https://github.com/jobrien1726/WeatherPy). 

Data from a random selection of 500+ cities around the globe, varying in proximity to the Earth's equator, was collected using the OpenWeatherMap API. Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Windiness were all analyzed with regard to Latitude in order to get a closer look at how weather patterns change as one moves closer to the equator. The results of this analysis, including each respective scatter plot, is now available for user friendly exploration: [Equator Weather Analysis](https://jobrien1726.github.io/web-design-challenge/)
